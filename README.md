# Technical Majority

Hello! This is the repo that maintains technicalmajority.com, a clearinghouse
for information about technology partnering with activists and governments to
increase government by the people, for the people, of the people.

Think of this as an HTML wiki, we very much want additions and contributions.

All contributions and interactions are governed by our code of conduct.

It’s currently hosted entirely by me, but I _will sincerely appreciate_ any help
or thoughts. I’m not sold on the layout, or hierarchy, or anything - consider it
a blank slate with a domain where we want to catalog tech activisim and civic
tech in 2017.
